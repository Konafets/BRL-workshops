```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)
```


## Exercise

Read in `NYCdogs.csv`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dogs <- read_csv("../data/NYCdogs.csv", na = "n/a")
```

1. Write the code to produce this output:

```{r}
dogs %>% 
  group_by(borough, spayed_or_neutered) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
```


2. Write the code to produce this output:

```{r}
dogs %>% 
  group_by(borough, spayed_or_neutered) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percent = count/sum(count))
```


3. Write the code to produce this output:

```{r}
dogs %>% 
  group_by(borough, spayed_or_neutered) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(percent = count/sum(count)) %>% 
  filter(spayed_or_neutered == "Yes") %>% 
  select(borough, percent_spayed = percent)
```
